# Graph Connectivity and Balance Checker
This repository contains a Python implementation of a graph data structure that allows for the creation of vertices and edges, along with methods to determine connected components and evaluate the balance of the graph based on edge signs.


## Usage
The main functionality is encapsulated in the Graph class, which provides methods to add edges, find connected components, and check graph balance.

## Features
Graph Creation: Initialize a graph with a specified number of vertices.
Edge Addition: Add edges between vertices with associated signs (+ or -).
Connected Components: Identify connected components in the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) for positive edges.
Edge Sign Management: Store and retrieve the signs of edges.
Balance Checking: Determine if the graph is balanced by checking for positive edges between different connected components
